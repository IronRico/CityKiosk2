# CityKiosk2

In essnce, I needed to create a launcher app that disables the ability for a user to access any settings aside from 
those implemented by the admin.  Same with app that are instaleld.  Only those deemed OK by the site Admin are
allowed.

Currently the app disallows the use of the back button and the power button's long press will not all you to shut off 
the Android device.  There is still so much more to do on the code itself to fully flesh out all the kinks.
Not to mention actual code cleanup and simple design practices to make for better looking work, (both in UI and code itself).
